                    Academic misconduct means an attempt by students to gain an
                    unfair advantage in their assessed work, including
                    assignments and examinations. Academic Misconduct includes
                    plagiarism, collusion, failure of disclosure, impersonation,
                    and other malpractices.

                    Except where otherwise clearly indicated; students shall be
                    assessed on the basis of their own unassisted and unaided
                    work.
                    <br />
                    Where feasible, coursework will be compared against
                    databanks of existing material in order to check whether
                    there is a degree of similarity that might arouse suspicions
                    of academic misconduct. Such a databank may also be used to
                    check whether there are pronounced differences in standard
                    or style between two or more pieces of work by the same
                    students sufficient to arouse suspicions of unauthorized
                    assistance or inauthenticity.
                    <br />
                    Assignments must include full disclosure of the following;
                    <br />
                    1. All sources of information used (which should be cited
                    according to normal scholarly conventions)
                    <br />
                    2. A full description of any help received in the
                    preparation of the assignment, with full identification of
                    the individual or individuals who provided the assistance.
                    <br />
                    3. Bribery in respect to preparation of the assignments
