									<p className="my-4 text-left">I am a Ugandan-born Canadian researcher, academic administrator and an award winning author
										of several books that have been ranked by Amazon as best sellers around the world. Currently I
										am honored to serve as Vice Chancellor of Victoria University Uganda. I am the author of both
										“You Can&#39;t Make Fish Climb Trees” and “Transform”. I also happen to be the first Education
										Scholar to research and introduce Authentic Learning Education in Uganda, with emphasis on
										Real-World Learning for all levels of education. <br/><br/>
										I am an ardent advocate for the implementation of a real-world Education Model that emphasizes
										both Experiential Learning (EXL) &amp; Work-Integrated Learning (WIL) programs to ensure that
										students maximize their learning and gain meaningful education. My transformational education
										research that embraces and embeds both technology and learning in the real-world has prepared
										me to deploy my unconscious mind that looks at education very differently with the intention of
										making learning relevant to every learner and making education work for everyone. I have been
										blessed to visit 47 countries for purposes of research and education advisory role. I have been
										privileged to advise education institutions in several countries including Sweden, Finland,
										Canada, USA, Ethiopia, Argentina, Singapore, Uganda, Solomon Islands and the list goes on.<br/><br/>
										In terms of Education background, I have had the opportunity to pursue my studies at several
										universities around the world including Makerere University, where I obtained both a Bachelors
										and Master’s Degree in Economics, then University of Alberta in Canada where I successfully
										attained both a Master’s in Education and PHD in Educational Administration and Leadership.
										Because we live in a world where lifelong learning has become part of us; I further ended up at
										Harvard University to pursue my Post- Doctoral studies focusing on Higher Education Teaching.
										I have also been awarded the title of Honorary Professorship of the Academic Union by the
										Academic Union of Oxford, UK for my continued contribution towards developing the
										University of the Future driven by Digital Transformation.<br/><br/>
										Some of my work as an educationist has focused on transforming education to make it fit in the
										times we live in now and those we anticipate in the future, in fact, one of my education books
										focusing on authentic learning attracted several awards and grants including a $1,300,000 grant
										from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. This remarkable book &quot;YOU CAN&#39;T MAKE FISH
										CLIMB TREES - OVERCOMING EDUCATIONAL MALPRACTICE THROUGH
										AUTHENTIC LEARNING&quot;, has been praised, endorsed and promoted by Uganda&#39;s First Lady
										and Minister of Education and Sports (MOES), Hon. Janet Kataha Museveni. The book has
										triggered the infusion of Authentic Learning into Uganda&#39;s Curriculum for the first time in the
										history of Uganda&#39;s education system and this initiative no doubt puts the country&#39;s education on
										course to greatness.<br /><br />
