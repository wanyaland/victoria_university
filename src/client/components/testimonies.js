									I have been a student at Victoria University for the last two years, and I can assure you that I have had a great experience. This is a great university. The lecturers are very reasonable and fair. The support staff is excellent. We also have a great regulatory system, which promotes creativity and acceptance in the divergence in views; for all of us to contribute to solutions daily. We have student-centered education in this university, and we just do not sit back to take notes from lectures. We also have practical or call it authentic learning; which allows us to practically try out what we study in class, daily. Why would this be impossible, when the founders of this university, as the leaders in business in this country, with a chain of companies and partnerships? Apart from academics, we are involved in sports and entertainment. We have vast access to entertainment, political, and media celebrities since some of them are our fellow students. Everyone at Victoria University is destined for a great future.

									I chose Victoria University because of its central location in the capital city of Kampala, which is very accessible and of a shorter distance to the University, I chose doing BACHELOR’S DEGREE IN SCIENCE OF OIL AND GAS ACCOUNTING because currently in Uganda, the Oil and Gas sector has limited local skilled man power and I wanted to be skilled to contribute to the sector. Accounting Aspect in my course has been most beneficial to my career development in that I know how to use and extract statement in Accounting to show whether a company is earning Profits or losses and know it's financial position to show the total assets and liabilities for that a company. My favorite memory was when I was given an opportunity to perform and act as a Secretary to the University Electoral commission where I actively participated in electoral commission meetings and compiled minutes for all the meetings.

									<br/>I chose VU because it was only the best place for me as a foreign student to complete my studies and it is also among the best universities in the country and I chose public health because it was my passion first and I have always loved saving life and this was directly my only option for me so i am proud of the choice of myself. To be honest, most of them were perfect where I learned a lot and other modules such as communication skills, and it was not in my program but VU had helped me by studying it and now I know some aspects of this module. It's when they (VU) tell the students that the exams are coming soon! MDR

									<br/>Vu is more than a university, it gives you the knowledge, confidence skills, and experience that you are looking for to make your environment better. Whether you're a mature student or a school leaver Vu opens up a host of new opportunities to control your future. Also being an international university, I wanted to meet many international students from different countries with different backgrounds and with different experiences, and that would give me a range of experience to broaden my knowledge. 
									1. Communication skills [ listening, speaking and writing] 
									2. Ability to make decisions and solve problems.
									3. Flexibility and Adaptability.
									My favorite memory of Vu is the day I got to campus and I was told by security personnel that I can't enter with my bag. That day I became mad at everyone

									<br/>Victoria University was a dream come true for my dad and I, Victoria University is an institution that put the students’ needs first more than anything. Choosing my course was easier because I loved playing around with computers since childhood, more so the course was a two in one course, which was IT and business related, so I needed to spice up my IT with business theory. The curriculum currently has well revised modules which bring more of hands-on training and a broad approach towards critical thinking individually or as a group. Furthermore, the equipment at VU is favorable towards the everyday student environment. The lecturers are very friendly which creates a one-on-one interaction. My best memory is the cultural gala which was in November 2019, it was a beautiful and tremendous day where people exhibited their backgrounds. I learnt a lot about different cultures from different countries and tribes.

									<br/>I chose Victoria University above all the others because it understands what one requires and nurture them according to their abilities which I have already experienced and in regards to my course, I chose it according to my talent. I love business and I Majorly enjoy marketing of which my university got me to kind of check my instincts of marketing by making an advert. My favorite memory at VU is the time when I was making the advert with all the willingness and passion within me.
